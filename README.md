# Churn

Churn prediction in the telecommunication industry. It's a classification problem where 
the data were taken from a machine learning competititon. The project was first done with SAS and SAS Enterprise Miner. I translated a part of the code from SAS to R. I used caret package and randomForest algorithm. More details can be found in the code.

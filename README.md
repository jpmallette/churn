# Churn

Churn Prediction in the telecommunication industry. It's a classification problem where 
the data are taken from a machine learning competititon. The project was first done with SAS and SAS Enterprise Miner. I am translated a part of the code from SAS to R where I run a randomForest algorithm. More details can be found in the code.
